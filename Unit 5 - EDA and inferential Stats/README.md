# Unit 5 - EDA and Inferential Stats

In this unit, we focus on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using various techniques to understand and uncover insights from the data. We dive into both **univariate** and **bivariate** analysis. The exercises are based on a dataset from Amazon UK and aim to explore product attributes, pricing strategies, and ratings.

## Lab Overview:

1. **Lab - EDA Univariate Analysis**: 
   - **Objective**: Explore product listing dynamics and extract actionable business insights by analyzing the distribution, central tendencies, and relationships of various product attributes.
   - This lab will cover basic statistics and visualizations such as frequency tables, measures of centrality and dispersion, and histograms.

2. **Lab - EDA Bivariate Analysis**: 
   - **Objective**: Dive deeper into product insights by analyzing the relationship between product pricing and other variables like product categories and ratings.
   - This lab will involve advanced visualizations like violin plots, correlation coefficients, and statistical tests (Chi-square, Cramér's V).

## Directory Structure:

- **`lab-eda-univariate/`** — Contains exercises for univariate analysis (distribution, central tendencies, pricing, and ratings).
- **`lab-eda-bivariate/`** — Contains exercises for bivariate analysis (relationships between price, ratings, categories, and more).
- **`lab-2/`** — Lab on advanced analysis for **bivariate** correlations and visualizations.
