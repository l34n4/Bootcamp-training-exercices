# Lab: Python Data Structures

## Objective

This lab focuses on learning how to use Python data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets in a practical scenario. The goal is to build a program that manages an online store's inventory and customer orders.

## Features

1. Create and manage an inventory of products.
